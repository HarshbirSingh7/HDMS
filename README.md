# 🏨 Hotel Database Management System (HDMS)

A **GUI-based Hotel Database Management System** built using **Python**, designed to manage hotel records efficiently using a CSV file as the database.  
The project provides an easy-to-use graphical interface instead of a command-line system.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Hotel Database Management System (HDMS)** is a **GUI-based Python application** that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on hotel guest records.  
It uses a CSV file (`Hotel.csv`) for persistent data storage and follows a modular structure by separating frontend, backend, and data visualization logic.

This project is especially useful for:
- Students learning **Python GUI programming**
- Beginners exploring **database concepts without SQL**
- Understanding **file handling and data visualization**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **GUI Library** (Tkinter)
- **CSV File Handling**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib** (for graphical data visualization)
- Standard Python libraries
